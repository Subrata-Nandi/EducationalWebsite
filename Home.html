      <h3>
        The growth of Information Technology (IT) has resulted in more change to
        human society in the last decade than in the last century combined. It’s
        also possible that the next 10-15 years will bring about more change to
        the world than seen throughout the entirety of human history. Computer
        science professionals are in demand in almost every sector and country
        in the world. There are many great reasons to study computer science at
        university, such as career opportunities, high earning potential and the
        opportunity to make the world a better place. Studying a computer
        science degree will equip you with the skills and knowledge required to
        step into an exciting, ever-developing industry.
      </h3>
      <br />
      <h2>Why study computer science?</h2>
      <br />
      <h3>1. We are in a digital age</h3>
      <h4>
        The growth of computer power has brought miraculous breakthroughs in
        hardware and software, which have in turn changed global behavior and
        culture. Computer science is responsible for smartphones, tablets, the
        internet and networked communications, even social media. We live in a
        society that consumes content – whether that be news, information,
        entertainment, or communication – through screens. We are truly living
        in a digital age, driven by computer science.
      </h4>
      <br />
      <h3>2. Make the world a better place</h3>
      <h4>
        As a result of the digital age, businesses are increasingly relying on
        software programs to deliver, acquire, and transmit data across a
        multitude of platforms. This trend impacts all industries, from
        healthcare and banking to transportation and accounting. Even household
        objects that have been around for decades such as refrigerators, door
        locks, and microwave ovens, are now becoming smart, connecting to
        personal assistants and Wi-Fi networks. Computer science has helped
        improve living conditions and avert disasters, for example by predicting
        earthquakes or tsunamis. With your computer science degree, you can help
        to make the world, faster, better, and far more connected.
      </h4>
      <br />
      <h3>3. High earnings</h3>
      <h4>
        The world of IT will continue to grow and provide more jobs in all
        sectors. Computer science is a challenging subject, which makes a degree
        highly respected around the world. Computer science experts are sought
        after in all industries and sectors, and graduates can enter the world
        of work on a good salary with many opportunities for career progression
        and higher earnings. For example, according to a Payscale report, the
        average salary for a Software Development Director is 143,000 USD, and a
        Security Consultant earns 85,600 USD on average, per year.
      </h4>
      <br />
      <h3>4. Variety of specializations</h3>
      <h4>
        As computer science is used in so many areas of life and business, there
        are plenty of choices available to qualified professionals. When you
        graduate with your computer science degree, and even while on your
        degree program, you’ll be faced with a variety of specializations and
        roles, such as:
        <ol>
          <li>Software developer</li>
          <li>Computer systems analyst</li>
          <li>IT manager</li>
          <li>Computer network architect</li>
          <li>Mobile application designer or developer</li>
          <li>Research and development (R&D) scientist</li>
          <li>Computer scientist</li>
          <li>Computer science researcher</li>
          <li>Artificial intelligence and machine learning engineer</li>
        </ol>
      </h4>
      <br />
      <h3>5. Global opportunities</h3>
      <h4>
        One of the key benefits of studying computer science is the global
        opportunities that your degree can offer. Computer science graduates are
        in high demand all over the world. Whether you plan to launch your
        career in your home country and then travel, or look for international
        roles straight after graduation, you will find plenty of job
        opportunities. Additionally, many computer science roles can be carried
        out remotely, meaning that you could work with colleagues and companies
        all around the world while still living in the country of your choice.
      </h4>
      <br />
      <h3>6. Transferrable skills</h3>
      <h4>
        A computer science degree will equip you with a wide variety of skills,
        many of which are transferable to other lines of work and study.
        Studying computer science will help you to develop problem-solving,
        critical thinking and complex analytical skills. Skills such as these
        are especially useful for specialists working with complex algorithms
        and big data to create instructions and understand design patterns.
        However, they are interchangeable and transferable to many professions,
        both inside and outside of IT.
      </h4>
      <br />
      <h3>7. Ongoing technological developments</h3>
      <h4>
        While the world continues to advance its IT infrastructure across all
        major economic industries, new languages, frameworks, and development
        environments are being produced at unforeseen speeds. For instance, Big
        Data is a disruptor for many, as large organizations consume massive
        pools of arranged information to better serve customers and understand
        consumer behavior. Other examples include automated payment systems to
        improve and streamline financial transactions, and fitness centers
        assisting with tracking health and heart rates. Virtual reality
        technology alone is now far more than an entertainment device; from real
        estate firms now using head-mounted displays to allow potential
        homeowners to walk through a living space before purchasing, to fashion
        retailers providing digital avatars and environments to try on clothes.
        This ongoing development brings with it massive scope for progression
        and learning opportunities. A computer science degree will teach you
        about how far things have come and also the direction that the world is
        now heading in.
      </h4>
      <br />
      <h3>8. Use your creativity</h3>
      <h4>
        Unlike mathematics, in which there is only one answer to a problem,
        computer science allows infinite solutions to the same problem; the goal
        is to find and take advantage of the most efficient solution. Computer
        applications can be written and developed in many ways to suit any kind
        of purpose or user experience. Therefore, it provides a great window of
        creative opportunity for a professional. Once you have gained the
        knowledge and skills from your computer science degree, you can use your
        creative mind as well as your scientific mind in your day-to-day work.
